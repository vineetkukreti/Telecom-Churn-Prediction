## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop an accurate churn prediction model that can help the company identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them. Customer churn prediction is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction, reducing revenue loss, and maximizing profitability in the telecommunications industry.

## Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
The dataset used for churn prediction contains information about telecom customers, including various features that might influence their likelihood of churning. Data preparation involves handling missing values, outlier detection and treatment, data scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, techniques such as addressing class imbalance are employed to ensure the dataset is suitable for building machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing the distribution of features, correlation between variables, and patterns in churn behavior. Techniques such as univariate analysis, target variable distribution analysis, and correlation analysis are employed to gain insights into the dataset. EDA helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data and identifying key factors influencing churn behavior.

## Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models. Techniques such as feature scaling, transformation, creation of new features, and handling imbalanced data are applied to preprocess the data. The goal is to enhance the predictive power of the model and improve its ability to accurately identify churned customers.

## Model Building <a name="model-building"></a>
Several machine learning models are built for churn prediction, including logistic regression, PCA with logistic regression, LASSO with decision tree and random forest, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier. Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Train-Test Splitting <a name="train-test-splitting"></a>
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. A split ratio of 70% training data and 30% testing data is chosen to ensure robust evaluation of the model's performance.

### Feature Selection Techniques <a name="feature-selection-techniques"></a>
Feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination (RFE), principal component analysis (PCA), and LASSO are employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve model performance.

### Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation"></a>
Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score, are used to assess the performance of each model. Insights gained from model evaluation guide the selection of the best-performing model for churn prediction.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The Random Forest model with LASSO feature selection demonstrates superior performance in predicting customer churn, highlighting the importance of feature engineering and selection in improving model performance. Further research could explore additional data sources and refine feature engineering techniques to build more robust churn prediction models.

## Future Work <a name="future-work"></a>
Future work could focus on exploring additional data sources, refining feature engineering techniques, and evaluating alternative algorithms to further improve churn prediction accuracy.
